#Question # 2 - Facebook - Active Users Retention

#Assume you have the table below containing information on Facebook user actions. 
#Write a query to obtain the active user retention in July 2022. Output the month (in numerical format 1, 2, 3) and the number of monthly active users (MAUs).

#Hint: An active user is a user who has user action ("sign-in", "like", or "comment") in the current month and last month.

user_actions table -
